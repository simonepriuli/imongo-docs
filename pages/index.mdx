# Introduction

IMongo is a TypeScript package that provides schema validation and interaction helpers for MongoDB through Zod.

## Why IMongo?

These are some of the features that IMongo offers:
- MongoDriver and Zod out of the box
- Less boilerplate
- No need to remember any MongoDriver types
- Easy to setup, easy to use
- Powerful schema validation


## Go to package page

You can find the package on NPM [https://www.npmjs.com/package/imongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imongo).

## Side by side comparison with MongoDriver

```js filename="With MongoDriver"
import * as mongoDB from "mongodb";

const client: mongoDB.MongoClient = new mongoDB.MongoClient("cluster-url");
await client.connect();
const db: mongoDB.Db = client.db("db-name");
const usersCollection: mongoDB.Collection = db.collection("users");

const users = await usersCollection.find().toArray();
```

```js filename="With IMongo"
import { db } from "imongo";

await db.init("cluster-url", "db-name").connect();
db.useCollection("users");

const users = await db.collection("users")?.find().toArray();
```

As you can see with IMongo you don't have to remebered all this different types, you just create an instance of IMongo class and use the provided methods. Other than that IMongo provides schema validation with Zod out of the box (MongoDriver doesn't).
