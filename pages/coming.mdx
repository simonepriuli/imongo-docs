# What's coming in 1.2.1

### Try the beta

To try the beta you have to run the following command, however it is not reccomanded to do it in production code.
```bash filename="Beta installation" copy
npm i imongo@beta
```

### No more need to instanciate the imongo class.

Old method:

```js filename="Import"
import { imongo } from "imongo";
const db = new imongo();
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
```

New method:

```js filename="Import"
import { db } from "imongo";
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
```

Note that you can instanciate new imongo classes anyway by importing **imongo** from **"imongo/lib/core"**.

### Updated useSafeValidation

Now useSafeValidation requires a check on the success property of the object  by default.

This won't work anymore:

```js filename="Old useSafeValidation usage"
const user = db.useSafeValidation({ name: "Simone" });
await db.collection("users")?.insertOne(user);
```

You have to check on the user.success property first like this:

```js filename="New useSafeValidation usage"
const user = db.useSafeValidation({ name: "Simone" });
if (user?.success) {
  await db.collection("users")?.insertOne(user);
}
```

### No need to import Zod anymore

Before you had to install Zod and import Z from it by yourself like this:

```bash filename="Zod Installation"
npm i zod@latest
```

```js filename="Import Zod old method"
import { z } from "zod";
```

Now imongo install it for you and expose the z object.

```js filename="Import Zod new method" copy
import { db, z } from "imongo";
```
