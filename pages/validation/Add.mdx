# Add a schema to a collection

To use the validation features you need to have Zod installed on your machine.

```bash filename="Zod Installation" copy
npm i zod@latest
```

Add a schema to a collection by calling the setSchema() method.

```js filename="Add a schema" copy
db.setSchema(z.object({zod-schema}, 'collection name');
```

Note that passing the collection name is optional if the setSchema() method is chained to the useCollection() method like this.

```js filename="Chain the setSchema method" copy
db.useCollection('users').setSchema(z.object({zod-schema});
```

All the above methods don't work if you pass an array as param at the useCollection method.
