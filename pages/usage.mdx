# Usage

### Import
The first step is is to import imongo.

```js filename="Import" copy
import { imongo } from "imongo";
```

### Class instace
Now you have to declare an instace of IMongo, we suggest to call it db.

```js filename="Class instance" copy
const db = new imongo();
```

### Setup
To connect to the MongoDB Cluster and database you have to call the init() method and pass the connection url (without the database name insede of it) and the database name.

```js filename="Init" copy
db.init("cluster-url", "database-name");
```

### Connect
Now you can call the async method connect().

```js filename="Connect" copy
await db.connect();
```

Note that you can also chain the init() and the connect() methods like this.
It might be useful to do so when you don't need to export to the whole project the imongo class instance.

```js filename="Init" copy
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
```

### useCollection
Now you need to set the collections we might need to use with the useCollection() method.

```js filename="useCollection" copy
db.useCollection("users");
```

You can also pass an array of strings but it's not recommended for reaseons you'll see later.

```js filename="useCollection with array" copy
db.useCollection(["users", "posts"]);
```
### Usage with MongoDriver
Finally you can use the MongoDriver methods (ex: find, findOne, insert, etc.) calling the collection() method.

```js filename="MongoDriver methods" copy
const posts = await db.collection("posts")?.find().toArray();
```

Note that if you want to call MongoDb.Db methods (create db users, create collections, etc.) you have to call the database() method.

```js filename="Database" copy
const database = db.database();
```

### Summary
Everything togheter should look like this:
```js filename="Everything"
import { imongo } from "imongo";

const db = new imongo();
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
db.useCollection("users");
const users = await db.collection("users")?.find().toArray();
```
