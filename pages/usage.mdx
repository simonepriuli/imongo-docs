# Usage

The first thing to do is to import imongo.

```js filename="demo.js" copy
import { imongo } from "imongo";
```

Now you can declare our instace of IMongo

```js filename="demo.js" copy
const db = new imongo();
```

To connect to the MongoDB Cluster and database we need to call the init() method and pass the connection url (without the database name insede of it) and the database name.

```js filename="demo.js" copy
db.init("cluster-url", "database-name");
```

Now you can call the async method connect().

```js filename="demo.js" copy
await db.connect();
```

Note that you can also chain the init() and the connect() methods like this.
It might be useful to do so when you don't need to export to the whole project the imongo class instance.

```js filename="Init" copy
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
```

Now you need to set the collections we might need to use with the useCollection() method.

```js filename="useCollection" copy
db.useCollection("users");
```

You can also pass an array of strings but it's not recommended for reaseons you'll see later.

```js filename="useCollection with array" copy
db.useCollection(["users", "posts"]);
```

Finally you can use the MongoDriver methods (ex: find, findOne, insert, etc.) calling the collection() method.

```js filename="MongoDriver methods" copy
const posts = await db.collection("posts")?.find().toArray();
```

Note that if you want to call MongoDb.Db methods (create db users, create collections, etc.) you have to call the database() method.

```js filename="Database" copy
const database = db.database();
```
