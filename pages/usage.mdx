# Usage

### Import
The first step is to import db from imongo.

```js filename="Import" copy
import { db } from "imongo";
```

### Setup
To connect to the MongoDB cluster and database you have to call the init() method and pass the connection url (without the database name in it) and the database name.

```js filename="Init" copy
db.init("cluster-url", "database-name");
```

### Connect
Now you can call the async method connect().

```js filename="Connect" copy
await db.connect();
```

Note that you can also chain the init() and the connect() methods like this.

```js filename="Init" copy
await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
```
It might be useful to do so when you don't need to export to the whole project the imongo class instance.

### useCollection
Now for every collection you want to use, you have to set it with the useCollection() method.

```js filename="useCollection" copy
db.useCollection("users");
```

You can also pass an array of strings (collections) but it is not recommended as you can't chain the setSchema() method wich is considered to be a best practice.

```js filename="useCollection with array" copy
db.useCollection(["users", "posts"]);
```
### Usage with MongoDriver
Finally you can use the MongoDriver methods (ex: find, findOne, insert, etc.) calling the collection() method.

```js filename="MongoDriver methods" copy
const posts = await db.collection("posts")?.find().toArray();
```

Note that if you want to call MongoDb.Db methods (create db users, create collections, etc.) you have to call the database() method.

```js filename="Database" copy
const database = db.database();
```

### Summary
Everything togheter should look like this:
```js filename="Everything"
import { db } from "imongo";

await db.init("cluster-url", "database-name").connect();
db.useCollection("users");
const users = await db.collection("users")?.find().toArray();
```
